At first I couldn’t give the space optimized solution . He gave me some hints and ultimately I could give the space optimized solution .

I could give the recursive solution for this but it was not space optimized , so he gave me several hints . I followed them ,even went in the right direction but couldn’t come up with the correct solution . However I shared my thought process throughout the discussion .

Twist: this time celebrity may or may not know some persons in the party. Suggested him O(n^2) approach. Using stack we can minimize comparisons.

Ques2: Given an unsorted array that contains even number of occurrences for all numbers except two numbers. Find the two numbers which have odd occurrences in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space. Told him that I know its approach already. He asked me for the approach.
