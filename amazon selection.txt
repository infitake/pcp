Matrix based question : 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/ (ok in this matrix the upper left is the smallest no and down right is largest number and we start with left top and bottom and if value is small then goes up otherwise right)


https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/ (ok)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/ (ok think with recurision)
At first I couldn’t give the space optimized solution . He gave me some hints and ultimately I could give the space optimized solution .
 

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/ (ok using mid logic)
I could give the recursive solution for this but it was not space optimized , so he gave me several hints . I followed them ,even went in the right direction but couldn’t come up with the correct solution . However I shared my thought process throughout the discussion .

1. Remove unnecessary brackets from expression (ok using infix to postfix then using queue and stack over postfix)
ex: input (a+b)+((c+d)) and output should be (a+b)+(c+d).
2. Find the longest sub string length which is in Alphabetical order.(ok same as lis but in alphabetical order)

Twist: this time celebrity may or may not know some persons in the party. Suggested him O(n^2) approach. Using stack we can minimize comparisons.
